# Aren't there enough React devs already?!
Just one more react dev wouldn't hurt. Hi, I'm Ryan. Welcome to my little corner of github! This Github Site serves as something of an interactive CV, showcasing my love for all things React and some of the projects I've worked on.

I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building intuitive user interfaces using React and you'll find information about my work experience and technical skills on this page.

Yet _another_ react dev huh, so what sets me apart? It's my love of writing code that people don't hate working on. We all know a guy that codes like a robot and every time you have to work on something he has touched its like stepping into the Matrix. When I come across a code that's a hot mess, it's makes me recoil like a video game nerd watching someone break the seal a valuable collectable. I love a good refactor, beautifying until it's just right. When I'm done, that code is so readable, you could practically read it like a novel.

I mean, think about it - readable code is like a love letter to your future self (or another developer who has to work on the same codebase). It's like saying, "Hey, I care about you and your sanity, so I'm going to make sure this code is easy to understand and maintain."

So yes, I take readable code seriously. And if you're looking for a developer who will take your codebase from hot mess to work of art, then look no further. I'm your person.

So if you're looking for a React developer who's passionate, dedicated, and slightly obsessed with code quality, then you've come to the right place. Let's build something amazing together!
