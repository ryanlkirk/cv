                <p class="mb-10">Hi, I'm Ryan. Welcome to my little corner of Github! I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building intuitive and beautiful user interfaces using React.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">Yet another react dev huh? So what sets me apart? It's my love of writing code that people don't hate working on. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-10">I mean, think about it - readable code is like a love letter to your future self (or another developer who has to work on the same codebase). It's like saying, "Hey, I care about you and your sanity, so I'm going to make sure this code is easy to understand and maintain."
                    So yes, I take readable code seriously.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">I have worked on products that are used by hundreds of thousands of individual users, across more than 30 countries and 4 continents.
                    I've had the pleasure of building performant, reliable software that is trusted by a wide array of customers, from tiny rural schools to billion dollar businesses.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-10">
                    So if you're looking for a React developer who's passionate, dedicated, and slightly obsessed with code quality, then you've come to the right place. Let's build something amazing together!

                                <p>As a front-end developer at Service Power, I have taken on a variety of tasks and projects.
                                    One of my first accomplishments was improving the user interface, which involved designing the updated UI using figma and implementing changes into the app

                                <p class="pt-20">Since then, I have expanded my expertise to encompass all areas of the application, including user management, calendar views, maps, and data analysis

                                <p class="pt-20">
                                    Recently, I had the opportunity to work on Service Power products, which allowed me to step outside of my comfort zone and explore a rendering engine for HTML canvas.
                                    Although this was initially challenging, the end result was extremely rewarding and provided me with invaluable knowledge and increased confidence when approaching new and complex challenges.

                            I created a twitch chatbot using Node JS and twitch API's to monitor incoming messages in twitch
                            streams. It had the ability to block offensive words, block repeat offenders of rule breaches, tell
                            jokes, greet people when they entered the chat, respond to commands and share information at set
                            time intervals.

                                    time to give to a friend who streamed video games on Twitch. He was struggling to focus on
                                    streaming while dealing with requests in the stream chat and contending with the abuse and
                                    trolling that can come from that platform.

                                    joke from an API that returned a random joke. It would also keep track of whether a person spoke for the first time in chat and greet
                                    them when they did, plus a few other basic features such as time based announcements and reminders to follow on social media platforms.

                                As a front-end developer at Juniper, my work was to some extent a continuation of the work I had started at OTrack.
                                The application was built using React, and I was responsible for implementing UI designs created by the lead designer and integrating these features into the product.

                            <p class="pt-20">
                                My role involved working on all front-end areas of the application, including data dashboards, data entry screens, and user management areas.
                                I collaborated with other developers and stakeholders to ensure that the app was user-friendly and delivered a seamless experience for end-users.

                                One of the key strengths of the platform was its ability to integrate with other products across the business, as well as external systems, such as management information systems, via API's.
                                This allowed for a seamless transfer of data between multiple systems and enhanced the overall functionality of the app.

                                In addition to my core responsibilities, I also played an active role in troubleshooting and resolving technical issues that arose, working closely with the development team to identify and resolve any bugs or glitches in the app.
                                Through my work at Juniper, I gained valuable experience in front-end development, data management, and API integration, contributing to the overall success of the platform.

                            <p>OTrack was my introduction to the coding world. i did a variety of roles here before ending in the front end developer role. I developed Crystal Reports alongside a small amount of database work, then moved on
                                to manage the Crystal Reports development team. As this was phased out, I began learning to code to move onto their web product.

                            <p class="pt-20">By the time I joined the front end dev team, the existing app was starting to show its age so the decision was made to start rebuilding a modern version. I joined the team early in the development of the new version, which was being made in React.
                                As I joined so early in the project, I was exposed to a lot of the challenges that come with starting to build a product from scratch. Being part of the product development so early on allowed me to very quickly get an understanding
                                of all the moving parts behind the scenes that made a successful web app. I spent my time learning as much as possible and developed my skills on the fly whilst working on the app.

                                Building OTrack was a fantastic learning experience for me to start developing my understanding of authentication, databases and communication with API's and getting to see first hand what
                                it takes to see a product through from a concept to relative completion.
