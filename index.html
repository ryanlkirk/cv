                <p class="mb-10">Welcome to my little corner of Github! I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building intuitive and beautiful user interfaces using React.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">Yet another react dev huh? So what sets me apart? It's my love of writing code that people don't hate working on.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-10">I mean, think about it - readable code is like a love letter to your future self (or another developer who has to work on the same codebase). It's like saying, "Hey, I care about you and your sanity, so I'm going to make sure this code is easy to understand and maintain."
                    So yes, I take readable code seriously.</p>
                <p class="mb-10">I have worked on products that are used by hundreds of thousands of individual users, across more than 30 countries and 4 continents.
                    I've had the pleasure of building performant, reliable software that is trusted by a wide array of customers, from tiny rural schools to billion dollar businesses.

                <p class="mb-10">
                    So if you're looking for a React developer who's passionate, dedicated, and slightly obsessed with code quality, then you've come to the right place. Let's build something amazing together!

                                    Recently, I had the opportunity to work on Service Power products, which allowed me to step outside of my comfort zone and explore a rendering engine for HTML canvas.
                                    Although this was initially challenging, the end result was extremely rewarding and provided me with invaluable knowledge and increased confidence when approaching new and complex challenges.

                            jokes, greet people when they entered the chat, respond to commands and share information at set

                                    joke from an API that returned a random joke. It would also keep track of whether a person spoke for the first time in chat and greet
                                    them when they did, plus a few other basic features such as time based announcements and reminders to follow on social media platforms.

                                As a front-end developer at Juniper, my work was to some extent a continuation of the work I had started at OTrack.
                                The application was built using React, and I was responsible for implementing UI designs created by the lead designer and integrating these features into the product.

                                My role involved working on all front-end areas of the application, including data dashboards, data entry screens, and user management areas.

                                One of the key strengths of the platform was its ability to integrate with other products across the business, as well as external systems, such as management information systems, via API's.
                                This allowed for a seamless transfer of data between multiple systems and enhanced the overall functionality of the app.

                                Through my work at Juniper, I gained valuable experience in front-end development, data management, and API integration, contributing to the overall success of the platform.

                                As I joined so early in the project, I was exposed to a lot of the challenges that come with starting to build a product from scratch. Being part of the product development so early on allowed me to very quickly get an understanding
                                of all the moving parts behind the scenes that made a successful web app. I spent my time learning as much as possible and developed my skills on the fly whilst working on the app.
