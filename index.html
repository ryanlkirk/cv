                    I created a twitch chatbot using Node JS and twitch API's to monitor incoming messages in twitch
                    streams. It had the ability to block offensive words, block repeat offenders of rule breaches, tell
                    jokes, greet people when they entered the chat, respond to commands and share information at set
                    time intervals.

                        <p>This was a project I worked on in my spare
                            time to give to a friend who streamed video games on Twitch. He was struggling to focus on
                            streaming while dealing with requests in the stream chat and contending with the abuse and
                            trolling that can come from that platform.
                        <p class="pt-20">I saw an opportunity to get some basic
                            understanding
                            of node and improve my coding skills. After a fair few videos and many hours of trail and
                            error
                            I built an app that could be ran locally on his machine every time he streamed.</p>
                        <p class="pt-20">
                            This bot had its own user account and permissions as an admin on his twitch channel and
                            would monitor incoming messages for spam/abuse, respond to commands such as "!joke" and return a random
                            joke from an API that returned a random joke. It would also keep track of if a person spoke for the first time in chat and greet
                            them when they did, plus a few other basic features such as time based announcements and
                            reminders to follow on social media platforms.
