                        I created a twitch chatbot using Node JS and twitch API's to monitor incoming messages in twitch
                        streams. It had the ability to block offensive words, block repeat offenders of rule breaches, tell
                        jokes, greet people when they entered the chat, respond to commands and share information at set
                        time intervals.

                            <p>This was a project I worked on in my spare
                                time to give to a friend who streamed video games on Twitch. He was struggling to focus on
                                streaming while dealing with requests in the stream chat and contending with the abuse and
                                trolling that can come from that platform.

                            <p class="pt-20">I saw an opportunity to get some basic understanding of node and improve my coding skills. After a fair few videos and many hours of trial and
                                error I built an app that could be run locally on his machine every time he streamed.</p>

                                This bot had its own user account and permissions as an admin on his twitch channel and
                                would monitor incoming messages for spam/abuse, respond to commands such as "!joke" and return a random
                                joke from an API that returned a random joke. It would also keep track of whether a person spoke for the first time in chat and greet
                                them when they did, plus a few other basic features such as time based announcements and reminders to follow on social media platforms.

                        <p class="pt-20">The app was built using React for the front end. The focus was to build on the app that we started at OTrack, adding new features and rebranding the app
                            to match the new branding guidlines. We added features that saved teachers time using tools such as rapid data entry though mass entry options and providing them with data analysis they would normally have to do manually.

                            The platform was connected with other products across the business and also with external products such as managment information systems via API's, allowing
