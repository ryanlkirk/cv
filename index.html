                            <p>Juniper is my current role and I work on the front end application. One of my first tasks was to improve some aspects of the UI. I redesigned these in Figma and after approval from the product owner, then
                                implemented those changes into the app.
                            </p>
                            <p class="pt-20">I've worked on just about every area of the app at this stage, from user management area and calendar views to maps and data analysis.

                                Working on the Service Power products gave me the new opportunity of working with the HTML canvas through a rendering engine that I was unfamilar with. This was extremely challenging as it was completely
                                outside my comfort zone of anything I have worked on before but the end outcome was a lot of knowledge gained, very rewarding and gave me an increased confidence in taking on new and complex challenges.

                        I created a twitch chatbot using Node JS and twitch API's to monitor incoming messages in twitch
                        streams. It had the ability to block offensive words, block repeat offenders of rule breaches, tell
                        jokes, greet people when they entered the chat, respond to commands and share information at set
                        time intervals.

                            <p>This was a project I worked on in my spare
                                time to give to a friend who streamed video games on Twitch. He was struggling to focus on
                                streaming while dealing with requests in the stream chat and contending with the abuse and
                                trolling that can come from that platform.
                            </p>
                            <p class="pt-20">I saw an opportunity to get some basic understanding of node and improve my coding skills. After a fair few videos and many hours of trial and
                                error I built an app that could be run locally on his machine every time he streamed.</p>

                                This bot had its own user account and permissions as an admin on his twitch channel and
                                would monitor incoming messages for spam/abuse, respond to commands such as "!joke" and return a random
                                joke from an API that returned a random joke. It would also keep track of whether a person spoke for the first time in chat and greet
                                them when they did, plus a few other basic features such as time based announcements and reminders to follow on social media platforms.

                        <p>OTrack was my introduction to the coding world. i did a variety of roles here before ending in the front end developer role. I developed Crystal Reports alongside a small amount of database work, then moved on
                            to manage the Crystal Reports development team. As this was phased out, I began learning to code to move onto their web product.

                        <p class="pt-20">By the time I joined the front end dev team, the existing app was starting to show its age so the decision was made to start rebuilding a modern version. I joined the team early in the development of the new version, which was being made in React.
                            As I joined so early in the project, I was exposed to a lot of the challenges that come with starting to build a product from scratch. Being part of the product development so early on allowed me to very quickly get an understanding
                            of all the moving parts behind the scenes that made a successful web app. I spent my time learning as much as possible and developed my skills on the fly whilst working on the app.

                            Building OTrack was a fantastic learning experience for me to start developing my understanding of authentication, databases and communication with API's and getting to see first hand what
                            it takes to see a product through from a concept to relative completion.
